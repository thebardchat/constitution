# CLAUDE.md — constitution

> Claude Code configuration for the `thebardchat/constitution` repository.

---

## Project Overview

This repository holds the **ShaneTheBrain Constitution** — the single source of truth governing every project, tool, and decision in the `thebardchat` ecosystem.

This project operates under the [ShaneTheBrain Constitution](https://github.com/thebardchat/constitution/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md).

---

## Infrastructure

All `thebardchat` repositories run on the following local-first infrastructure:

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Compute** | Raspberry Pi 5 (16 GB RAM) |
| **Chassis** | Pironman 5-MAX by Sunfounder (NVMe RAID) |
| **Storage** | 2x WD Blue SN5000 2 TB NVMe — RAID 1 via mdadm |
| **Core path** | `/mnt/shanebrain-raid/shanebrain-core/` |
| **Local AI** | Ollama (llama3.2:1b default) |
| **Vector memory** | Weaviate (Docker, 8080/50051) |
| **MCP server** | FastMCP (port 8008, Streamable HTTP) |
| **Networking** | Tailscale VPN across all nodes |
| **Dev environment** | Claude Code on Pi 5 |

> Pi before cloud. Privacy before convenience. — Pillar 4

## Working With This Repo

- **Do not copy** the Constitution into other repos. Link to it instead.
- Reference line for other repos:
  ```md
  This project operates under the [ShaneTheBrain Constitution](https://github.com/thebardchat/constitution/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md).
  ```
- Amendments follow the process in Article VI — version bump, pillar check, and `constitution(vX.X):` commit prefix.

## The Nine Pillars (Quick Reference)

1. **Faith First** — No project violates Christian values
2. **Family Stability** — No build ships at the cost of family
3. **Sobriety Integrity** — Every tool reinforces health
4. **Local-First AI** — Pi before cloud, privacy before convenience
5. **80/20 Shipping** — Done and deployed beats perfect and stalled
6. **Serve the Left-Behind User** — Build for the ~800M Big Tech forgot
7. **Open by Default** — Free when it can be
8. **ADHD-Aware Design** — Built for my brain first
9. **Gratitude is Infrastructure** — Credit Claude, Raspberry Pi, and Pironman — always

## Claude Code Rules
- Commit and push directly to `main`. Do NOT create branches.
- Run build/test commands before committing.
- Update CLAUDE.md session log before final commit.


## Networking / Deployment
- When working with Tailscale Funnel, remember it strips URL path prefixes. Always use hardcoded base paths rather than server-side form action prefixing for routing.

## Creative Writing
- Never overwrite or rewrite the user's creative voice, prose style, or intentional structural choices (e.g., missing notes, dialogue rhythm). Ask before making stylistic changes to creative writing files.

## General Workflow Rules
- Before setting up repos, SSH keys, or services, check what's already configured on the current machine. Run `ls ~/.ssh/`, `git remote -v`, `tailscale status`, etc. before assuming fresh setup is needed.
- Let's focus on one thing at a time. Don't suggest other improvements until the current goal is fully verified working.
- Before applying changes to all files, show the result on one file first so Shane can verify the approach.

## Git
- For git conflicts, always verify --theirs vs --ours semantics before applying. State which version you're keeping and why before running the command.

## Raspberry Pi Environment
- This user runs services on Raspberry Pi. Be aware: Python 3.13 removed the `cgi` module, Piper TTS needs careful noise_scale tuning to avoid clipping, and aplay conflicts with PipeWire. Prefer `pw-play` or `paplay` for audio playback.
